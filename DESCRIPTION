Title: Fast Correlation, Covariance, and Cosine Similarity
Version: 0.2-2
Description: Fast, optimized methods for computing covariance,
    correlation, and cosine similarity. Separate implementations
    are available for a dense matrix, two dense vectors, or a
    sparse matrix. The use of these methods is transparent to the
    user and handled automatically based on the input data, 
    handled by R's S3 methods.  Full description of the algorithms
    and benchmarks are available in the package vignettes.
