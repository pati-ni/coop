Title: Fast Correlation, Covariance, and Cosine Similarity
Version: 0.2-0
Description: Offers a single function to very quickly compute
    cosine similarity.  Separate, optimized methods are available
    for a dense matrix, two dense vectors, or a sparse matrix.
    The use of these methods is transparent to the user and
    chosen automatically based on the storage type of the input
    data, handled by R's S3 methods.  See the package 'README.md'
    file for a description of the algorithms and benchmarks.
